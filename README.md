  Songs of the Seas
</h1>

This is a for fun project about sea shanties. I was interested in creating a site, and at the time was playing the game Sea of Theives, then around that same time Sea Shanties were trending on Tik Tok, so I decided to create a site centered around this, as the only other sites were 20+ years old and extremely outdated, most likely from people just like me who wanted to have some fun at the time and develop a site :)

This is created with the gatsby starter default, uses netlify CMS for creating content, hosted on netlify
