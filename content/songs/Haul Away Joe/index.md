title: "Haul Away Joe"
lyrics: "When I was a little boy, or so me Mother told me,
Away haul away, we'll haul away Joe
That if I did not kiss the girls, me lips would grow all moldy
Away haul away, we'll haul away Joe

Away haul away, we'll haul for better weather
Away haul away, we'll haul away Joe
Away haul away, we'll haul away together
Away haul away, we'll haul away Joe

[...]
"
