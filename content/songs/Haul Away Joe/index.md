title: Haul Away Joe
lyrics: |-
  When I was a little boy, or so me Mother told me,


  Away haul away, we'll haul away Joe


  That if I did not kiss the girls, me lips would grow all moldy


  Away haul away, we'll haul away Joe


  Away haul away, we'll haul for better weather


  Away haul away, we'll haul away Joe


  Away haul away, we'll haul away together


  Away haul away, we'll haul away Joe
