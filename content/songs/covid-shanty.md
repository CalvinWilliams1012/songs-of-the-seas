***\[Solo]***

There once was a bug that couldn't be seen

And the name of the bug was Covid-19

The bug it spread from town to town

And that made everyone down

***\[Chorus]***

But soon may the doctors come

To stick a vaccine in your arm

And one day when the jabbin' is done

That bug will leave and go!

***\[Solo]***

Well, the bug it mucked up everyone's lives

And we're all going mad cos we're stuck inside

We've gone so mad that we feel no shock

When shanties trend on Tik Tok!

***\[Chorus]***

Soon may the nurses come

To stick a vaccine in your arm

And one day when the jabbin' is done

That bug will leave and go!

So, go get your vaccine done

So we can all stop feeling glum

One day when the jabbin' is done

We'll all be weller men!
