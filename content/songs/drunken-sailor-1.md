What shall we do with a drunken sailor? 

What shall we do with a drunken sailor? 

What shall we do with a drunken sailor, early in the morning?

Way ay and up she rises

Way ay and up she rises

Way ay and up she rises 

Early in the morning

What shall we do with a drunken sailor? 

What shall we do with a drunken sailor? 

What shall we do with a drunken sailor, early in the morning?

Put him in the long-boat till he gets sober

Put him in the long-boat till he gets sober

Put him in the long-boat till he gets sober

Early in the morning

What shall we do with a drunken sailor? 

What shall we do with a drunken sailor? 

What shall we do with a drunken sailor, early in the morning?

Keep him there and make him bail her

Keep him there and make him bail her

Early in the morning
