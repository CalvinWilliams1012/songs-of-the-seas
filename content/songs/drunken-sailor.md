***\[Solo]***

What shall we do with a drunken sailor? 

What shall we do with a drunken sailor? 

What shall we do with a drunken sailor, early in the morning?

***\[Chorus]***

Way ay and up she rises

Way ay and up she rises

Way ay and up she rises 

Early in the morning

***\[Solo]***

What shall we do with a drunken sailor? 

What shall we do with a drunken sailor? 

What shall we do with a drunken sailor, early in the morning?

***\[Chorus]***

Put him in the long-boat till he gets sober

Put him in the long-boat till he gets sober

Put him in the long-boat till he gets sober

Early in the morning

***\[Solo]***

What shall we do with a drunken sailor? 

What shall we do with a drunken sailor? 

What shall we do with a drunken sailor, early in the morning?

***\[Chorus]***

Keep him there and make him bail her

Keep him there and make him bail her

Keep him there and make him bail her

Early in the morning
