***\[Solo]***

Aye yo o, aye yo o

I thought I heard our captain say

***\[Chorus]***

Aye yo o, aye yo o

***\[Solo]***

O go on board your pilot boat

And roll her down the bay

***\[Chorus]***

Ha, ha my yaller girls

Good morning, ladies all

***\[Solo]***

Our Captain on the quarter-deck

***\[Chorus]***

Our Captain on the quarter-deck

***\[Solo]***

Was looking very sad

***\[Chorus]***

Ha, ha my yaller girls

Good morning, ladies all
