***\[Solo]***

He back, she back, daddy shot a bear, Shot him in the back and he never turned a hair, I'm just from the rail road, too - rer - loo, O the old moke picking on the banjo

***\[Chorus]***

Hooroo! What's the matter now? I'm just from the railroad, too - rer - loo, I'm just from the railroad, too - rer - loo, O the old moke picking on the banjo
