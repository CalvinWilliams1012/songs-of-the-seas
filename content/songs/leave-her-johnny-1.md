O the times are hard and the wages low

Leave her Johnny leave her

O the times are hard and the wages low

It's time for us to leave her

The bread is hard and the beef is salt

Leave her Johnny leave her

O, a leaking ship and a harping crew

It's time for us to leave her

Our mate he is a bully man

He gives us all the best he can

Leave her Johnny leave her

I've got no money, I've got no clothes

It's time for us to leave her

O, my old mother she wrote me

Leave her Johnny leave her

I will send you money, I will send you clothes

It's time for us to leave her
