      ***\[Solo]***

      O the times are hard and the wages low

      ***\[Chorus]***

      Leave her Johnny leave her

      ***\[Solo]***

      O the times are hard and the wages low

      ***\[Chorus]***

      It's time for us to leave her

      ***\[Solo]***

      The bread is hard and the beef is salt

      ***\[Chorus]***

      Leave her Johnny leave her

      ***\[Solo]***

      O, a leaking ship and a harping crew

      ***\[Chorus]***

      It's time for us to leave her

      ***\[Solo]***

      Our mate he is a bully man

      He gives us all the best he can

      ***\[Chorus]***

      Leave her Johnny leave her

      ***\[Solo]***

      I've got no money, I've got no clothes

      ***\[Chorus]***

      It's time for us to leave her

      ***\[Solo]***

      O, my old mother she wrote me

      ***\[Chorus]***

      Leave her Johnny leave her

      ***\[Solo]***

      I will send you money, I will send you clothes

      ***\[Chorus]***

      It's time for us to leave her
