***\[Solo]***

O the times are hard and the wages low

***\[Chorus]***

Leave her Johnny leave her

***\[Solo]***

O the times are hard and the wages low

***\[Chorus]***

It's time for us to leave her

***\[Solo]***

The bread is hard and the beef is salt

***\[Chorus]***

Leave her Johnny leave her

***\[Solo]***

O, a leaking ship and a harping crew

***\[Chorus]***

It's time for us to leave her

***\[Solo]***

Our mate he is a bully man

He gives us all the best he can

***\[Chorus]***

Leave her Johnny leave her

***\[Solo]***

I've got no money, I've got no clothes

***\[Chorus]***

It's time for us to leave her

***\[Solo]***

O, my old mother she wrote me

***\[Chorus]***

Leave her Johnny leave her

***\[Solo]***

I will send you money, I will send you clothes

***\[Chorus]***

It's time for us to leave her
