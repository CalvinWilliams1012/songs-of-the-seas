      ***\[Solo]***

      O the times are hard and the wages low

      ***\[Chorus]***

      Leave her Johnny leave her

      ***\[Solo]***

      O the times are hard and the wages low

      ***\[Chorus]***

      It's time for us to leave her

      ***\[Solo]***

      The bread is hard and the beef is salt

      ***\[Chorus]***

      Leave her Johnny leave her

      ***\[Solo]***

      O, a leaking ship and a harping crew

      ***\[Chorus]***

      It's time for us to leave her

      ***\[Solo]***

      Our mate he is a bully man

      He gives us all the best he can

      ***\[Chorus]***

      Leave her Johnny leave her

      ***\[Solo]***

      I've got no money, I've got no clothes

      ***\[Chorus]***

      It's time for us to leave her

      ***\[Solo]***

      O, my old mother she wrote me

      ***\[Chorus]***

      Leave her Johnny leave her

      ***\[Solo]***

      I will send you money, I will send you clothes

      ***\[Chorus]***

      It's time for us to leave her

      ***\[Solo]***

      Oh, the times were hard and the wages are low

      ***\[Chorus]***

      Leave her Johnny leave her

      ***\[Solo]***

      I guess it's time for us to go

      ***\[Chorus]***

      And it's time for us to leave her

      ***\[Solo]***

      Beware these packet ships I say

      ***\[Chorus]***

      Leave her Johnny leave her

      ***\[Solo]***

      They'll steal your stores and your clothes away

      ***\[Chorus]***

      And it's time for us to leave her

      Leave her, Johnny, leave her

      Oh leave her, Johnny, leave her

      For the voyage is done, and the winds don't blow

      and it's time for us to leave her

      ***\[Solo]***

      There's Liverpool Pat in his tarpaulin hat

      ***\[Chorus]***

      Leave her Johnny leave her

      ***\[Solo]***

      And Yankee John the pocket rat

      ***\[Chorus]***

      And it's time for us to leave her

      ***\[Solo]***

      She would not wear and she would not stay

      ***\[Chorus]***

      Leave her Johnny leave her

      ***\[Solo]***

      She shipped great seas both night and day

      ***\[Chorus]***

      And it's time for us to leave her

      ***\[Solo]***

      It's rotten beef and weevil-y bread

      ***\[Chorus]***

      Leave her Johnny leave her

      ***\[Solo]***

      It was pump or drown the old man said

      ***\[Chorus]***

      And it's time for us to leave her

      ***\[Solo]***

      The sails all furled, our work is done

      ***\[Chorus]***

      Leave her Johnny leave her

      ***\[Solo]***

      and now ashore we'll take our rum

      ***\[Chorus]***

      And it's time for us to leave her
