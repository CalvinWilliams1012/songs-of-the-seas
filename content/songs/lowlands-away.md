***\[Chorus]***

Lowlands, lowlands, away, my John

I'm bound away, I heard him say, My dollar and a half a day

***\[Solo]***

A dollar and a half won't pay my way

***\[Chorus]***

Lowlands, lowlands, away, my John

***\[Solo]***

A dollar and a half is oozer's pay

***\[Chorus]***

A dollar and a half a day

***\[Solo]***

A dollar and a half won't pay my way

***\[Chorus]***

A dollar and a half is a white-man's pay

***\[Solo]***

We're bound away to Mobile Bay

***\[Chorus]***

We're bound away to Mobile Bay

***\[Solo]***

What shall we poor matelors do?

***\[Chorus]***

What shall we poor matelors do?
