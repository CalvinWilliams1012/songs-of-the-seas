***\[Chorus]***

One more day, my Johnny, one more day

O rock and roll me over

For one more day

***\[Solo]***

There is one thing more that grieves me

***\[Chorus]***

For one more day

***\[Solo]***

There is my poor wife and baby

***\[Chorus]***

For one more day

***\[Solo]***

I'm bound away to leave you

***\[Chorus]***

For one more day

***\[Solo]***

Don't let my parting grieve you

***\[Chorus]***

For one more day
