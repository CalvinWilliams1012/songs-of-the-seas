***\[Solo]***

Ranzo, boys, Ranzo

O poor old Reuben Ranzo

***\[Chorus]***

Ranzo, boys, Ranzo

***\[Solo]***

O poor old Reuben Ranzo

***\[Chorus]***

Ranzo, boys, Ranzo

***\[Solo]***

O! Ranzo was no sailor

***\[Chorus]***

Ranzo, boys, Ranzo

***\[Solo]***

He shipped on board a whaler

***\[Chorus]***

Ranzo, boys, Ranzo

***\[Solo]***

He shipped with Captain Taylor

***\[Chorus]***

Ranzo, boys, Ranzo

***\[Solo]***

The man that shot the sailor

***\[Chorus]***

Ranzo, boys, Ranzo

***\[Solo]***

He could not do his duty

***\[Chorus]***

Ranzo, boys, Ranzo

***\[Solo]***

He couldn't boil the coffee

***\[Chorus]***

Ranzo, boys, Ranzo

***\[Solo]***

The Captain being a good man

***\[Chorus]***

Ranzo, boys, Ranzo

***\[Solo]***

He taught him navigation

***\[Chorus]***

Ranzo, boys, Ranzo

***\[Solo]***

We took him to the gratings

***\[Chorus]***

Ranzo, boys, Ranzo

***\[Solo]***

And gave him nine and thirty

***\[Chorus]***

Ranzo, boys, Ranzo

***\[Solo]***

O! that was the end of Ranzo

***\[Chorus]***

Ranzo, boys, Ranzo
