Way ay, roll and go

O Sally Brown she promised me

A long time ago

She promised for to marry me

Way ay, roll and go

O she promised for to marry me

A long time ago

O, Sally Brown's the girl for me

Way ay, roll and go

O, Sally Brown, she slighted me

A long time ago

As I walked out one morning fair

Way ay, roll and go

It's then I met her, I do declare

A long time ago
