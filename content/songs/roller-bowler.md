***\[Chorus]***

Hooray you roller, bowler

To my hi-rig-a-jig and a ha ha

Good morning ladies all

***\[Solo 1]***

O the first time that I saw her

***\[Solo 2]***

As I walked out one morning

***\[Chorus]***

Hooray you roller, bowler

***\[Solo 1]***

O the first time that I saw her

Twas down in Playhouse Square

***\[Solo 2]***

As I walked out one morning

Down by the river side

***\[Chorus]***

To my hi-rig-a-jig and a ha ha

Good morning ladies all

Hooray you roller, bowler

To my hi-rig-a-jig and a ha ha

Good morning ladies all

***\[Solo 3]***

O ladies short and ladies tall

***\[Chorus]***

Hooray you roller, bowler

***\[Solo 3]***

O ladies short and ladies tall

I love them all

***\[Chorus]***

To my hi-rig-a-jig and a ha ha

Good morning ladies all
