***\[Solo]***

O Shanadar

I love your daughter

***\[Chorus]***

Hooray you rolling river

***\[Solo]***

Shanadar

I love your daughter

***\[Chorus]***

Ha Ha 

I'm bound away to the wild Missouri

***\[Solo]***

O Shanadar

O seven years I courted Sally

***\[Chorus]***

Hooray you rolling river

***\[Solo]***

Shanadar

And seven more I couldn't gain her

***\[Chorus]***

Ha Ha 

I'm bound away to the wild Missouri

***\[Solo]***

O Shanadar

She said I was a tarry sailor.

***\[Chorus]***

Hooray you rolling river

***\[Solo]***

Shanadar

Farewell my dear I'm bound to leave you 

I'm bound away but will ne'er deceive you.
