***\[Solo]***

There once was a stock that put to sea

The name of the stock was $GME

The price blew up, the shorts dipped down

hold, my bully boys, hold

***\[Chorus]***

Soon may the Tendieman come

To send our rocket into the sun

One day, when the trading is done

We'll take our gains and go

***\[Solo]***

She had not been two weeks from shore

When Ryan Cohen joined the board

The captain called all hands and swore

He'd take his shares and hold

***\[Chorus]***

Soon may the Tendieman come

To send our rocket into the sun

One day, when the trading is done

We'll take our gains and go

***\[Solo]***

Before the news had hit the market

Wallstreetbets came up and bought it

With diamond hands, they knew they'd profit

If they could only hold

***\[Chorus]***

Soon may the Tendieman come

To send our rocket into the sun

One day, when the trading is done

We'll take our gains and go

***\[Solo]***

No deals were cut, no shorts were squeezed

The captain's mind was not on greed

But he belonged to the autist's creed

He took the risk to hold

***\[Chorus]***

Soon may the Tendieman come

To send our rocket into the sun

One day, when the trading is done

We'll take our gains and go

***\[Solo]***

For forty days, or even more

The stock went up, then down once more

All gains were lost, it was looking poor

But still those traders did hold

***\[Chorus]***

Soon may the Tendieman come

To send our rocket into the sun

One day, when the trading is done

We'll take our gains and go

***\[Solo]***

As far as I've heard, the fight's still on

The shorts not squeezed and the gains not won

The Tendieman makes his regular call

To encourage the captain, crew, and all

***\[Chorus]***

Soon may the Tendieman come

To send our rocket into the sun

One day, when the trading is done

We'll take our gains and go

Soon may the Tendieman come

To send our rocket into the sun

One day, when the trading is done

We'll take our gains and go
