***\[Solo]***

Ah the bully boat is coming

Don't you hear the paddles rolling?

***\[Chorus]***

Rando, rando, hooray, hooray

***\[Solo]***

The bully boat is coming

Don't you hear the paddles rolling?

***\[Chorus]***

Rando, rando, ray

***\[Solo]***

Ah! the bully boat is coming

Down the Mississippi floating

***\[Chorus]***

Rando, rando, hooray, hooray

***\[Solo]***

As I walked out one May morning

to hear the steam-boat rolling

***\[Chorus]***

Rando, rando, ray
