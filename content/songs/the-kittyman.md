***\[Solo]***

There once was a cat with a hungry belly

The name of the cat was Whiskers Jelly

His throat was dry and his bowl was bare

Meow my furry cats meow

***\[Chorus]***

Soon may the Kittyman come

With some birds and mice and some tasty nums

One day when the critters come

We'll eat 'til our bellies are full

***\[Solo]***

Well Jelly got his boys and they gathered round

They scattered seeds from a sack they found

In hopes the seeds they spread on the ground

Would bring small critters aboot

***\[Chorus]***

Soon may the Kittyman come

With some birds and mice and some tasty nums

One day when the critters come

We'll eat 'til our bellies are full

***\[Solo]***

Well the gang was bored and morale had dipped

'til one of the seeds grew green catnip

They sniffed and they snacked and they all got ripped

They all had a meow that night

***\[Chorus]***

Soon may the Kittyman come

With some birds and mice and some tasty nums

One day when the critters come

We'll eat 'til our bellies are full

***\[Solo]***

Well their heads were hung when the morn was nigh

The nip was strong and they all got high

Their bellies were shrunk and their bowls still dry

Oh bring us some mice today

***\[Chorus]***

Soon may the Kittyman come

With some birds and mice and some tasty nums

One day when the critters come

We'll eat 'til our bellies are full
