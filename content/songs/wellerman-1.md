***\[Solo]***

There once was a ship that put to sea,

and the name of that ship was the Billy O' Tea

The windows blew hard, her bow dipped down,

blow me bully boys blow (Huh!)

***\[Chorus]***

Soon may the Wellerman come

To bring us sugar and tea and rum

One day when the tonguin' is done

We'll take our leave and go

***\[Solo]***

She had not been two weeks from shore

When down on her a right whale bore

The captain called all hands and swore

He'd tag that whal in tow (Hah!)

***\[Chorus]***

Soon may the Wellerman come

To bring us sugar and tea and rum

One day when the tonguin' is done

We'll take our leave and go

***\[Solo]***

Before the boat had hit the water,

the whale's tail came up and caught her

All hands to the side, harpooned and fought her

when she dived down below (Huh!)

***\[Chorus]***

Soon may the Wellerman come

To bring us sugar and tea and rum

One day when the tonguin' is done

We'll take our leave and go

***\[Solo]***

No line was cut, no whale was freed

The captain's mind was not on greed

but he belonged to the whaleman's creed

She took that ship in tow (Huh!)

***\[Chorus]***

Soon may the Wellerman come

To bring us sugar and tea and rum

One day when the tonguin' is done

We'll take our leave and go

***\[Solo]***

For forty days, or even more

the line went slack then tight once more

All boats were lost, there were only four

but still that whale did go

***\[Chorus]***

Soon may the Wellerman come

To bring us sugar and tea and rum

One day when the tonguin' is done

We'll take our leave and go

***\[Solo]***

As far as i've heard, the fight's still on

The line's not cut and the whale's not gone

The Wellerman makes his regular call

***\[Chorus]***

To encourage the captain crew and all

Soon may the Wellerman come

To bring us sugar and tea and rum

One day when the tonguin' is done

We'll take our leave and go

Soon may the Wellerman come

To bring us sugar and tea and rum

One day when the tonguin' is done

We'll take our leave and go
