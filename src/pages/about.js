    <p>My name is Calvin Williams, I created this site as I found that while similar sites existed, they seemed to be 10+ years old with no updates. As I was already becoming interested in Shanties, I thought I would give a shot at developing a site about them.
         I originally created this without any knowledge of Sea Shanties other than the fact I liked them... I hope to have captured the correct information, contact me otherwise!</p>
    <p>You can find my personal site <a href="https://calvinwilliams.ca">here</a></p>
